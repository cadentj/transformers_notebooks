    "In 2017, Google Brain released a paper titled *Attention is All you Need*, where they departed from the traditional Seq2Seq architectures used in NLP and introduced a new kind of architecture: the transformer. As the title of their paper suggests, the transformer is based on attention mechanisms, and does not use any kind of recurrent states as in RNNs. This meant that a transformer could be trained significantly faster than a Seq2Seq model using RNNs, as sequences were no longer processed one token at a time, but rather all at once. It also significantly reduced the complexity of the models being worked with. As opposed to having complex Seq2Seq variations that can quickly become intractable, the transformer is composed of relatively straightforward matrix multiplications all the way through."

    "Let's start with tokenization. A model's \"vocabulary\" isn't simply a list of words like we've done previously. Transformers use subword tokenization instead of full words. We can think of tokens as individual, meaningful components of language, with parts like prefixes root words (or parts of root words), suffixes, and the like. Learning the atomic structure of language allows our model to generalize onto never-before-seen words and form more a nuanced representation of language.\n",

    "\n",
    "Could we just use the 256 ASCII characters? This fixes the previous problem, but it loses structure of language - some sequences of characters are more meaningful than others. For example, \"language\" is a lot more meaningful than \"hjksdfiu\". We want \"language\" to be a single token, but not \"hjksdfiu\" - this is a more efficient use of our vocab.\n",
    "\n",
    "What actually happens? The most common strategy is called **Byte-Pair encodings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with the 256 ASCII characters as our tokens, and then find the most common pair of tokens, and merge that into a new token. Note that we do have a space character as one of our 256 tokens, and merges using space are very common. For instance, here are the five first merges for the tokenizer used by GPT-2 (you'll be able to verify this below).\n",
